# Caterpillar Game

## Overview
In the Caterpillar Game, players guide a hungry caterpillar through a 2D grid filled with food. As the caterpillar eats, it grows longer, reminiscent of the classic Snake game. The challenge increases with the caterpillar's length, requiring players to avoid collisions with walls and the caterpillar's own body. The game serves as an entertaining way to apply Java data structures in a familiar, arcade-style context.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK)

## Setup
1. Download the game source code.
2. Ensure JDK is installed.
